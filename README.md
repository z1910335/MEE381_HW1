~Code written to complete problems can be found under Commits
* Group A: Problem 1:
For the given number of random numbers being 800,000, adding an array of doubles proved to consistently take more time than adding an array of floats.
  I thought it worth mentioning the number of random numbers. At smaller values of n, floats would take longer. For my computer, the turnover was around n = 80,000, however,
  the time it took to complete calculations varied significantly. 
* Group B: Problem 3:
Math.Sqrt was the fastest operation, followed closely by Direct Multiplication. Math.Pow was roughly 5 Times slower than both Math.Sqrt and Direct Multiplication!
